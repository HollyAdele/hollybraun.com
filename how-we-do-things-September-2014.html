				<h1>How We Do Things</h1>
				<h2>Ages and Stages</h2>
				<p>Heidi, 3.5. Peter, 2. Austin, 3 months.</p>
				<h2>Schedule</h2>
				<p>6:00 Austin wakes up to eat, then will lay quietly in bed until breakfast.</p>
				<p>6:15 Heidi wakes up. She wakes up Peter, they go into the kitchen and eat some slices of bread. Then they go find the step stool to turn on their light.</p>
				<p>7:15 Heidi and Peter start fighting loud enough to wake me up. I change Peter's diaper, get them some water, and break up the fight. This sometimes makes them go away until breakfast, sometimes they keep yelling until breakfast.</p>
				<p>7:45 I get up to start oatmeal, put away the dishes, and make my husband's lunch (not because he makes me, but because his love language is acts of service.  And I happen to love him.) Here is my <a href="http://theldsmothersroom.wordpress.com/2013/11/13/my-oatmeal-recipe/" target="_blank">oatmeal recipe</a>.  Other variations I have discovered is a scoop of raisins or dried apple chips or a can of pears or peaches added while the oats are cooking, or strawberries or bananas added right before serving. If I wake up too late, we have cereal and the dishes don't get put away.</p>
				<p>8:15 We have the one family meal of the day, breakfast. </p>
				<p>8:30 Austin goes to sleep very easily for an hour and a half. </p>
				<p>10:00 Austin wakes up and we go on our daily outing: grocery shopping, library trip, a walk to the pond or the sidewalk overpass to watch cars below on the highway, or an errand or a playdate (except for Mondays, which are laundry days).  Austin sleeps super well in the Moby wrap, so I wear him during our outing.  We also use a baby leash for Peter, because he hates to hold hands and I don't trust him to keep himself safe while we are near a street.  I usually pack lunch, which consists of a peanut butter and honey sandwich and fruits and vegetables. Peter doesn't eat the crusts of his sandwich unless I break them off bit by bit and give them to him one at a time before I give him the "nice soft center."  I feel that it's worth the effort because it's food, and I don't want him in the habit of wasting food.</p>
				<p>1:00 We get home, Peter takes a nap in my bed (it will be a long time before we do naptime potty training). Austin sleeps swaddled in the closet and Heidi does quiet time in the kids room.  I get down her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Disney-Princess-Enchanted-Cupcake-Party/dp/B007B7LTE6" target="_blank">cupcake game</a>, puzzles or other small toys (that are high on the shelf because I don't want to clean them up every day, and I am a control freak.) I also put my iPad on the shelf and turn on <a href="http://www.scripturescouts.com/" target="_blank">Scripture Scouts</a>.  I set her alarm for two hours later.  She can come out to go potty and to ask me one question.  She doesn't get snacks or different toys after she has started. If she abuses this rule, I put a doorknob cover on.</p>
				<p>2:00 I have time to work on my monthly goal. </p>
				<p>4:00 I start cooking dinner.  These days, I have a <a href="http://theldsmothersroom.wordpress.com/2014/08/31/freezer-meals/" target="_blank">freezer meal</a> ready for me.  Heidi and Peter don't usually get a snack before dinner because then they don't eat dinner.  Snacks are never as healthy or cheap as dinner, because I don't put as much effort into them as dinner.  And so they fill up on unhealthy, expensive food and don't eat my healthy, cheap dinner that I spent a lot of time on. So instead of eating snacks, they yell at me and each other. Right before anyone kills anyone else, dinner is ready.</p>
				<p>5:20 We eat dinner: pizza, enchiladas, burritos, tacos, veggie pancakes, German pancakes, soup, pepper-lime chicken, spaghetti, or scrambled eggs. I aspire someday to add quinoa and copycat recipes. Eating food is about nurturing bodies and relationships (which is why eating unhealthy food by yourself is pointless. And why I feel bad when I do it.)</p>
				<p>6:00 Bathtime, if we have eaten spaghetti (which they do in underwear) of if Peter's earwax starts getting out of control.  These two events happen about as often as they need baths.</p>
				<p>6:30 I start getting them ready for bed.  Any later than this, and Heidi fights me at every step.  They can play until 7:30 or so, and then we clean up, count all the pieces in the cupcake game to make sure we have them all and to practice counting, have a story (which they get to pick, unless I don't feel like reading the one they picked.  They accept this because in the past, I have fought this battle.  I refused to read a story I didn't feel like reading.  I don't feel bad, okay, I do a little, but I shouldn't because it's in their best interest that I not hate storytime.  We go to the library frequently enough that we have a selection of books I feel like reading).  Then a scripture story (which is usually talking about a picture from the <a href="http://store.lds.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product3_715839595_10557_3074457345616706170_-1__195548" target="_blank">gospel art kit</a>. Then we have a prayer, which regularly ends in yelling becaues Peter interrupts Heidi's prayer with his own prayer, which always is "Dear Heavenly Father, Thank you for Heidi and Peter to feel better, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen."  Then Heidi goes potty, I fill up sippy cups halfway, make sure Heidi's "nose rag" and "tear towel" (a piece of minky fabric.  She hates to wipe tears on her shirt or pillow, and she got pinkeye from wiping her eyes on her nose rag) are in place, get Peter his pacifier and monkey blanket, which I keep high up in the closet, shut the blackout curtains, and sing a Primary song as long as both kids are in their bed. Then I shut the door (with the doorknob cover) and say goodnight. I make an effort to meet all their needs before I shut the door, and then I don't respond to any more requests.  Hence the tear towel. They play for another 45-60 minutes (in the dark!) and then all is quiet.</p>
				<p>8:00 I finish with bedtime routine and then am free to work on my monthly goal. Austin goes to bed at some point prior to this.  It's usually between 6 and 8, and he does so without a fuss.  Like he does everything.</p>
				<p>10:00 I'm supposed to stop what I'm doing, put the dishes in the dishwasher, lock the doors, brush my teeth, say goodnight to Bryan, and be in bed by 11.  Austin usually wakes up before I fall asleep or right after. I feed him, he goes back to sleep.  He'll wake up two or three more times during the night, as will Heidi or Peter.</p>
				<p>I do scripture study on my phone while I nurse Austin.  I have bookmarks for my place in the Book of Mormon, my place in Preach My Gospel, the next Sunday School lesson, the next Relief Society lesson, my place in General Conference, the Ensign, and the nursery manual.</p>
				<p>Theoretically I shower at some point.  Maybe during Austin's first nap, maybe during quiet time, maybe after dinner, maybe before bed.  Maybe not.</p>
				<p>I just figured out what it would mean for me to get the recommended amount of exercise.  An hour of vigorous exercise (can't talk, can't sing), so running fast, on Saturday and Wednesday before breakfast. A brisk walk (can talk, can't sing), for 30 minutes on three other days during our outings. Strength training of every major muscle group (I do it at home with my set of <a href="http://theldsmothersroom.wordpress.com/2013/07/25/fitness-month/" target="_blank">equipment free exercises</a> on Tuesday or Thursday during Austin's first nap. Then yoga every night before bed. That's my interpretation of the recommended amount of exercise.  It's a lot!  You can get pretty fit if you just meet the recommendations. And remember, exercising is about being healthy and strong, not skinny.</p>
				<p>Heidi is preschool age, but it doesn't make a lot of sense to send her because I don't have a job, but I was trained to be a teacher.  We don't sit down and do worksheets often, I read on homeschooling blogs that it's too early to start formal education because they'll get burned out and starting early doesn't really translate into long-term benefits anyway. But we have lots of interesting experiences in connection with our weekly gifts.</p>
				<p>Heidi's favorite toys are: cupcake game.  Drawing, painting, and coloring with markers.  Wearing her tinkerbell swimsuit.  Peter's favorite toys: his <a href="http://www.target.com/p/melissa-doug-doug-vehicles-and-tools-wooden-chunky-puzzle-bundle/-/A-10321603" target="_blank">vehicle puzzle</a> and his <a href="http://costcocouple.com/kid-galaxy-my-first-rides-mini-gogo-vehicles/" target ="_blank">cars</a>.  I have to put these up sometimes, because he will play with them all day, non-stop, and won't share.  Heidi gets lonely and she'll pick a fight with him.</p>
				<p>Overall, I feel that having my three kids, three and under, is intense but possible.  I feel overwhelmed and I yell when I don't get enough sleep.  When I do get enough sleep, I can take the fighting and the ridiculous requests.  Even though I have two toddlers and a baby to take care of, I still do have many enjoyable moments with each one.  I adore them.  I love Heidi's sweetness and Peter's sense of humor and Austin's easy-going personality.  If I had fewer children, Heidi's hair would probably be neater, Peter would do more chores, and Austin would maybe be exposed to fewer germs, but he also would lay on the floor by himself more often and have fewer adoring fans.  Heidi and Peter would not have a 24/7 playdate during which to practice social skills.  I'm foregoing a career to stay home with children, and I can take care of one, or I can take of three.  We like to be efficient. ;)</p>
