			<h2>How to buy gifts for a Braun</h2>
			<p><strong>We believe the purpose of life is to grow</strong>.  We don't believe the purpose is to gather things.  We hope the things we receive will help us grow.</p>
			<p>We save gifts we receive during the month of December and open them on New Year's.  Gifts we give each other relate to what we plan to accomplish in the coming year.</p>			
			<p>P.S. Please don't feel obligated to spend money on us. We know you love us.</p>
