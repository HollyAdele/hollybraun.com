				<h1>Common Family History Excuses</h1>
				<h2>Someone in my family already "does" family history.</h2>
				<h2>My family history is already "done."</h2>
				<h2>I don't know how to do family history.</h2>
					<h3>Where to start</h3>
						<p>Choose a family. Narrow it down to a mother, a father, and their children. You could start with yourself, or the end of the line (where the fields are white), or some place with weak information or sources.</p>
						<p>Browse the FamilySearch Family Tree.  Familiarize yourself with the time frame, the names and relationships, and what ordinances need to be done.</p>
					<h3>Search FamilySearch Records</h3>
						<p>Begin with the Record Hints box on each person's page.  Check to see if that source has already been attached.  If not, attach it and update the person's information.  Take the time to fill in all the boxes, including "Why You Think This is Accurate." If you are thorough, and if you explain your work thoroughly, no one has to repeat your work.  If you work haphazardly, and hurry past explaining, your work will have been in vain.  Spend 5% more effort so someone else doesn't have to do 100% more effort.</p> 
						<p>Then search for them, starting vague and adding more search terms to narrow the results.</p>
						<p>If your family was in the United States, search for them in each census taken during their lives. The census isn't always accurate, but it can give you direction.</p>
					<h3>Search FamilySearch Books, Catalog, and the Wiki</h3>
						<p>When I was at the Family History Library in Salt Lake City about three years ago, workers were digitizing all their books.  I think the books were the last reason to go there in person.  Search for surnames.</p>
						<p>Searching the Catalog kind of scares me.  There is a lot of stuff there.  But it looks like that's what the Wiki is for: to help you parse through the catalog.  Search the wiki by place. City, county, and state. It gives you links to record collections to search through specific to your family's area.</p>
					<h3>Search Google</h3>
						<p>Just do it.  You know you want to.</p>
					<p>After you have searched all these resources, you might have all you need for your vital statistics (birth, marriage, and death dates and places.)  If some important information still eludes you, search places in Ancestry's <a href="http://www.ancestry.com/wiki/index.php?title=Red_Book:_American_State,_County,_and_Town_Sources" target="_blank">Red Book</a>.  Then search your library's catalog for books on the county, state, and city of interest.  Here in Virginia, the Fairfax Regional Library has a large section on family history books. That I have never looked in during the two years I have lived here.</p>
				<h2>Family history is for old people.</h2>
				<h2>I don't have time for family history.</h2>
				<h2>I've started family history, but I'm stuck.</h2>
				<h2>The church's family history technology is too hard to use!</h2>
				<h2>I can't make it to the family history library.</h2>
				<p>pick a family, do a locality survey, start with yourself and link with documents, open source everything.</p>
