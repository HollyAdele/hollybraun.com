				<h1>Weekly Gifts</h1>
				<p>As I was writing our <a href="Gifting Guide.html">Gifting Guide</a>, I thought long and hard about what would actually be blessings to my kids.  Would more toys help them or hurt them? What would actually help them develop?</p>  
				<p>I thought the best things for them would be to pursue their interest in meaningful ways.  So, art classes?  Dance classes?  Sports leagues?  They're two and three.  I'm pretty sure I can handle art projects, dance parties, and playing with balls with my toddlers.</p>
				<p>So I do. Each week we decide what we want to focus on, and we think of fun things to do that would fit with the theme.  It makes our days a lot more interesting.  You're supposed to do lots of things with them... read to them and make fun food for them and take them to parks and splash pads and go on walks and look at the bugs and cook with them and take them swimming and give them unstructured play... and it's hard to choose in the moment what to do.  Sometimes we just end up yelling at each other instead.</p> 
				<p>Weekly gifts have made our days a lot more interesting.  (Calling them gifts helps me remember that this is a labor of love, and not just another requirement on my list.</p>
				<h2>Past Gifts</h2>
				<p>Art Week.  Heidi loved this one.  Peter kind of made me crazy when we tried watercolors with him.  But Heidi ate it up.  Hopefully just figuratively.  We used crayons and colored pencils and markers and scissors and coloring books and scrapbook paper.  We blended primary colors and made a color wheel.  We even went to the Torpedo Factory Art Center in Alexandria, which is a cool old munitions plant turned art studios for rent, open to the public.</p>
				<p>Cooking Week. I let Heidi help me cook, which was stressful. She cracked her first egg! He was so happy that week.</p>
				<h2>Future Gifts</h2>
				<p>Vehicle Week.  Peter loves school buses and trains.  We walked to the elementary school and watched the buses drop off the kids at school.  Then from a sidewalk on an overpass, we watched cars, buses, and trains drive under us on the highway. </p>
				<p>Sports Week</p>
				<p>Reading Week</p>
				<p>Alphabet Week</p>
				<p>Music Week</p>
				<p>Animal Week</p>
				<p>Plant Week</p>
