				<h1>How We Do Things</h1>
				<h2>Ages and Stages</h2>
				<p>Heidi, 3.5. Peter, 2. Austin, 4 months.</p>
				<h2>Schedule</h2>
				<p>6:00 Austin wakes up to eat, possibly waking up the big kids.  I feed him, then put him in the little nursery I made for him behind a couch in the front room.  He has our second pack and play, a basket of toys, the diaper changing station, and a crib bedding set for decoration. If we were going to be here long term, I would buy room divider screens to make it look more complete. He will either go back to sleep or lay quietly in bed until breakfast.</p>
				<p>6:15 Heidi wakes up. She wakes up Peter, they go into the kitchen and sometimes eat some slices of bread. Then they go find the step stool to turn on their light.</p>
				<p>7:45 The alarm on the kids' clock goes off, and they come wake me up.  How's that for an effective alarm clock?  I get up to start oatmeal, put away the dishes, and make my husband's lunch (not because he makes me, but because his love language is acts of service.  And I happen to love him.) Here is my <a href="http://theldsmothersroom.wordpress.com/2013/11/13/my-oatmeal-recipe/" target="_blank">oatmeal recipe</a>.  Other variations I have discovered is a scoop of raisins or dried apple chips or a can of pears or peaches added while the oats are cooking, or strawberries or bananas added right before serving. I used to buy cereal to eat when I wake up too late, but I decided it was too expensive.  So now, if I wake up too late we muddle through with fruit, toast, and guilt which gets me up on time the next day.</p>
				<p>8:15 We have the one family meal of the day, breakfast. </p>
				<p>8:30 Austin goes to sleep very easily for an hour and a half. I don't go on outings daily anymore, because with three kids it is very intense, and I think that's why my kids got sick so often last winter, and it uses a lot of gas. These days, I nap, or the kids listen to stories I have recorded.  When they ask me to read stories, I try to record them using <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Audacity</a>, then export to MP3 using <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/help/faq_i18n?s=install&i=lame-mp3" target="_blank">a plugin</a>, then I load it on the iPod and speakers I keep in their room, behind a chair where Peter can't get to it.  Or we will work on our weekly gifts, or the kids will play on the porch, or we will color, or they will play while I do chores.  Staying home more often is not as bad as I thought it was going to be.  I dreaded this change, because it meant that I have too many children to go out with them.  I have since embraced this. </p>
				<p>12:00 Lunch.  PB sandwiches, fruit, veggies and hummus, leftovers.  On the wall in the kitchen I made a display like <a href="http://handsfullmom.blogspot.com/2014/09/seven-super-secrets-to-enjoying-general.html" target="_blank">this one</a>.  I have pictures of each apostle and a speech-bubble shaped sticky note of the main message of their talk.  I soon will get the women leaders up there, and the leaders of the other auxiliaries too.  It's motivation for me to watch them again because everyday Heidi and Peter say, "What did... Uchdorf say?" and I tell them.  I've got some of them memorized.  "What did... Eyring say?  What did... Hales say?"  They're getting pretty good at naming all the prophets.</p>
				<p>1:00 Peter takes a nap in my bed (it will be a long time before we do naptime potty training). Oddly enough, Austin sleeps in the "nursery", which is in the same room as people are playing in.  But he doesn't fuss about sleeping while kids are playing, for whatever reason. It's awesome.  I'm sure that at some point he'll be too old to stand for that anymore, and I'll have to find a solution.  At about this time, Heidi does quiet time in the kids room.  I get down her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Disney-Princess-Enchanted-Cupcake-Party/dp/B007B7LTE6" target="_blank">cupcake game</a>, puzzles or other small toys (that are high on the shelf because I don't want to clean them up every day, and I am a control freak.) I also put my iPad on the shelf and turn on <a href="http://www.scripturescouts.com/" target="_blank">Scripture Scouts</a> or <a href="http://www.mormonchannel.org/scripture-stories" target="_blank">Scripture Stories</a> that I have downloaded, or stories and songs I have recorded.  I set her alarm for two hours later.  We switched rooms recently.  Bryan and I sleep in the small "kids" room, which is just big enough for a bed and a crib.  The kids get the large master bedroom with bathroom attached. It's great because we can put the doorknob cover on at night to keep Peter in, but she can still go potty when she needs to.  I thought we would have problems with Peter playing in the toilet or getting in the tub or Heidi playing in the sink, but we haven't, for whatever reason.</p>
				<p>2:00 I have time to work on my monthly goal. </p>
				<p>3:00 I pick up sleeping Peter from my bed and put him in his own bed.  This wakes him up, and he can either relax with the pacifier and play with the special corner of his monkey blanket, or he can get up and do quiet time with Heidi.  Surprisingly, they go along with this.  They only fight a few times.  Heidi says she likes it because she's not lonely.  Sometimes I also put Austin in her room during quiet time, if he's being noisy.  He's too little to eat her small toys, and she knows to make sure his nose is free.  Heidi is kind of the secret to my success.</p>
				<p>4:00 I start cooking dinner.  These days, I have a <a href="http://theldsmothersroom.wordpress.com/2014/08/31/freezer-meals/" target="_blank">freezer meal</a> ready for me.  I am starting to believe in snacks, because Heidi has become out of control when she is hungry.  I need to figure out what to give them- the optimal blend of low cost, high nutrient, and quick to prepare. I also need to figure out what is the best time.</p>
				<p>5:20 We eat dinner.</p>
				<p>6:00 Bathtime.  I trust Heidi and Peter to play in the bath without me in there.  They will each yell if the other is under the water, and they both make enough noise in there that I know they're okay.  Heidi helps to hold Austin while I bathe him.</p>
				<p>6:15 Austin's bedtime.  I swaddle him and nurse him and put him to bed.  I didn't nurse Heidi to sleep, and she slept through the night quickly.  I nursed Peter to sleep and he didn't sleep through the night until 14 months.  Austin loves to be nursed right before bed, and sometimes he won't sleep unless his tummy was recently filled.  I have a battle ahead of me.  I don't really know what I am going to do yet.</p>
				<p>6:30 I start getting them ready for bed.  Any later than this, and Heidi fights me at every step.  You'll notice that my times for bathtime, Austin's bedtime, and the kids bedtime are unreasonably close together, revealing that I don't realize how long this process takes, which is why I am crabby and unorganized at this time.  They "brush their pajamas." (a remnant phrase from Joke Week.) I floss and brush each child.  I used to let them brush their own teeth, but then once I brushed Heidi's and she screamed because her gums hurt because they were unhealthy because she wasn't actually brushing her top teeth.  I clean up the room, with their help, I fill up their water cups. They can play until 7:30 or so, and then count all the pieces in the cupcake game to make sure we have them all and to practice counting, have a story (which they get to pick, unless I don't feel like reading the one they picked.  They accept this because in the past, I have fought this battle.  I refused to read a story I didn't feel like reading.  I don't feel bad, okay, I do a little, but I shouldn't because it's in their best interest that I not hate storytime.  We go to the library frequently enough that we have a selection of books I feel like reading).  Then a scripture story (which is usually talking about a picture from the <a href="http://store.lds.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product3_715839595_10557_3074457345616706170_-1__195548" target="_blank">gospel art kit</a>. Then they each say a prayer, and I sing them a song when they are laying in their beds. Then I shut the door (with the doorknob cover on the inside of their room and the adjoining bathroom) and say goodnight. I make an effort to meet all their needs before I shut the door, and then I don't respond to any more requests.  Ever since I started waking Peter up at 3, he goes to bed at a more reasonable time.</p>
				<p>8:00 I finish with bedtime routine and then am free to work on my monthly goal. Too much recently, I have spent too much time on Facebook or blog reading, and I don't get to my monthly goal. Lame.  Facebook time is almost completely a waste, but I still go there.</p>
				<p>10:00 I'm supposed to stop what I'm doing, put the dishes in the dishwasher, lock the doors, brush my teeth, say goodnight to Bryan, and be in bed by 11.</p>
				<p>I do scripture study during quiet time or after bedtime. I'm doing personal progress again because I'm an overachiever.  It's all online, and I think it's great. I can sign off on my value experiences!  It's so fun.</p>
				<p>Theoretically I shower at some point.  Maybe during Austin's first nap, maybe during quiet time, maybe after dinner, maybe before bed.  Maybe not.</p>
				<p>I do a short at-home exercise routine daily, and try to fit a run in here and there.  For my routine, I do pushups, lunges, plank, and wall sit.  I add on 5 reps or 30 seconds when I think I can, and I keep track in a notebook.  I'm up to 20 pushups, 20 lunges, 3 minutes of plank and 3 minutes of wall sitting.  During the plank and wall sit, I watch a video like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_eLZr24iMQ" target="_blank">this</a> on my iPad. It keeps me distracted and I time myself using the scrubbing bar on the video.</p>
				<p>Heidi is preschool age, but it doesn't make a lot of sense to send her because I don't have a job, and I was trained to be a teacher.  We don't sit down and do worksheets often; I read on homeschooling blogs that it's too early to start formal education because they'll get burned out and starting early doesn't really translate into long-term benefits anyway. But we have lots of interesting experiences in connection with our weekly gifts.  She has also started to read words like Heidi, Hi, Holly, Gin, Brenda, Bryan, no, on, and so on.</p>
				<p>Heidi's favorite toys are: cupcake game.  Drawing, painting, and coloring with markers.  Wearing her tinkerbell swimsuit.  Peter's favorite toys: his <a href="http://www.target.com/p/melissa-doug-doug-vehicles-and-tools-wooden-chunky-puzzle-bundle/-/A-10321603" target="_blank">vehicle puzzle</a> and his <a href="http://costcocouple.com/kid-galaxy-my-first-rides-mini-gogo-vehicles/" target ="_blank">cars</a>.</p>
				<p>I am getting used to having three kids. Since staying home more often (going to the library and grocery store on Saturday while Bryan watches the kids) and getting more sleep, I lead much more relaxed days. </p>
