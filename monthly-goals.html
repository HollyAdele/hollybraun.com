				<h1>Monthly Goals</h1>
				<p>I have more interests than time.  But I have finally found a way to pursue hobbies while being a stay-at-home mom of three.</p>  
				<p>Before I discovered this, I didn't accomplish much with my free time.  Unless you call being completely up-to-date with my news feed an accomplishment.  Which I don't.</p>
				<p>If I found myself with some free time, I would just turn to Facebook.  I had a thousand things I wanted to do, and a thousand more that I wanted me to want to do.  But just deciding which task to tackle took up most of my free time.  If I happened to work on it a bit, I used up the rest of the time just getting set up and reorienting myself.</p>
				<p>These days, I have something better.  Every few months, I make a list of things I want to learn about or work on. Then I assign them to coming months, and just do one thing a month.  It's awesome.  I get to focus completely on one subject at a time.  I don't spend so much time trying to remember what I did last time.  Also, I don't feel guilty pursuing a personal interest (like scrapbooking) instead of a duty (like researching my family history) because I know I will get to family history in just a few months.</p>  
				<p>Bryan used to do stuff like this before we were married, and he made a career with what he started during one of his monthly goals.  This guy also talked about it at TED.</p>

				<h2>Past Goals</h2>
				<p>July 2013 <a href="http://theldsmothersroom.wordpress.com/2013/07/25/fitness-month/">Fitness</a>, Lozi Lu Mud 5K</p>
				<p>August 2013 The LDS Mothers' Room blog</p>
				<p>September 2013 Family History.</p>
				<p>October 2013 Mother Education: read non-fiction parenting books and became active in a local mom's meetup.</p>
				<p>November 2013 Scrapbook.  Without my monthly goal system, I would feel guilty about taking an entire month for scrapbooking.  But having just fulfilled what I feel are my other duties, it was just plain fun.</p>
				<p>December 2013 Apparently I didn't have a goal this month.  I did visit my mom for Christmas and helped de-clutter (which is one of my favorite things to do. And Christmas is one of her favorites.  So are grandchildren.  So it was quite mutually beneficial.)</p>
				<p>January 2014 <a href="http://theldsmothersroom.wordpress.com/2014/01/30/photoshop-month/">Photoshop</a> This was the most productive month and $25 dollars I've spent.</p>
				<p>February 2014 Family History.  I found a newspaper in Omaha in which my family was mentioned several hundred times. I downloaded each article and updated our family tree with the new information.</p>
				<p>March 2014 Music: practice the piano and trumpet, organize music collection, burn CDs for the car, find new music.  I was supposed to buy new piano songs for myself and <a href="http://www.stagelightingstore.com/Atomic-Student-Xylophone-27-Keys?utm_medium=base&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjw06GfBRCR9tDI4t6n5_MBEiQAFo6kuO-x0mFQ29w05ab9cDkeYGFGmpdKbu_9laYhKzI9JggaAo5D8P8HAQ&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=products">xylophones</a> for the kids, but I didn't.  Crud.  They used to be $25, now they are $36. Maybe I'll just get one and they can fight over it.</p>
				<p>April 2014 College Classes: At <a href="coursera.org">coursera.org</a>, I signed up for three about dinosaurs, international development, and cooking.  I didn't get around to the one on dinosaurs. (I also did a lot of research on <a href="http://theldsmothersroom.wordpress.com//?s=natural+birth&amp;search=Go">natural birth</a> this month.)</p>
				<p>May 2014 Scrapbook.  Last scrapbooking month, I printed 300 photos for about $30.  And then I didn't get that far.  And then I discovered <a href="shutterfly.com">Shutterfly</a>.  Which turn out way better because you can resize the photos to fit the layout.  And it is cheaper than all the supplies for a paper scrapbook.  And you can order a copy whenever you want.  So I am going to do that from now on.</p>
				<p>June 2014 Give birth. And read fiction. I really enjoyed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Jackson">Percy Jackson</a> series, and I got my mom hooked on them, too.</p>
				<p>July 2014 Study the Gospel.  Focusing on scripture study when my life was changing with the new baby was probably good because I was sure to get it done.  I learned that questions are a blessing. When you have a real gospel question, it makes scripture study really interesting. I learned about the <a href="http://theldsmothersroom.wordpress.com/2014/07/24/the-age-of-accountability/">special status of children</a>.</p>
				<p>August 2014 Programming.  I'm using <a href="codecademy.org">codecademy.org</a> and so far I have learned html, css, and jQuery.  I still need lots of practice and I am a bit overwhelmed at all there is to learn, but it is fun knowing a little better what <a href="bryanbraun.com">my husband</a> is talking about.</p>
				<p>September/October 2014 Balance Week/Family History Month and a Half.  Life stepped in the way of a clear-cut monthly goal here.  But I did figure out a new exercise routine and get a little family history done.</p>
				<p>October 2014 Cleaning month/finish up a few side projects.  I did the side projects, not the cleaning.  Sorry, Bryan.</p>   
				<p>November 2014 Cooking month.  I made homemade hummus, ice cream, and cheesecake. I started out the month buying a lot of stuff to make fancy food, and I ended the month buying ingredients to use in tiny amounts to dress up cheap food.  The latter allows me to make meals for pennies.  I have decided to bake bread at home, and I am contemplating making cheese and yogurt at home as well.  Heidi loves baking.  It's a fun activity to do with kids <em>that saves you money</em>.
				<h2>Future Goals</h2>
				<p>December 2014 Plan learning activities for the kids.</p>
				<p>2015 I have a project I want to start on.  Once I figure out cooking, cleaning, kids' learning activities, and finish these projects, I will be ready to (not feel guilty while I) tackle it. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
