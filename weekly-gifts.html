				<h1>Weekly Gifts</h1>
				<p>As I was writing our <a href="Gifting Guide.html" target="_blank">Gifting Guide</a>, I thought long and hard about what would actually be blessings to my kids.  Would more toys help them or hurt them? What would actually help them develop?</p>  
				<p>I thought the best things for them would be to pursue their interest in meaningful ways.  So, art classes?  Dance classes?  Sports leagues?  They're two and three.  I'm pretty sure I can handle art projects, dance parties, and playing with balls with my toddlers.</p>
				<p>So I do. Each week we decide what we want to focus on, and we think of fun things to do that would fit with the theme.  It makes our days a lot more interesting.  You're supposed to do lots of things with them... read to them and make fun food for them and take them to parks and splash pads and go on walks and look at the bugs and cook with them and take them swimming and give them unstructured play... and it's hard to choose in the moment what to do.  Sometimes we just end up yelling at each other instead.</p> 
				<p>Weekly gifts have made our days a lot more interesting.  (Calling them gifts helps me remember that this is a labor of love, and not just another requirement on my list.</p>
				<h2>Past Gifts</h2>
				<p>Art Week.  Heidi loved this one.  Peter kind of made me crazy when we tried watercolors with him.  But Heidi ate it up.  Hopefully just figuratively.  We used crayons and colored pencils and markers and scissors and coloring books and scrapbook paper.  We blended primary colors and made a color wheel.  We even went to the Torpedo Factory Art Center in Alexandria, which is a cool old munitions plant turned art studios for rent, open to the public.</p>
				<p>Cooking Week. I let Heidi help me cook, which was stressful. She cracked her first egg! He was so happy that week.</p>
				<p>Vehicle Week.  Peter loves school buses and trains.  We walked to the elementary school and watched the buses drop off the kids at school.  Then from a sidewalk on an overpass, we watched cars, buses, and trains drive under us on the highway. </p>
				<p>Sports Week.  We didn't do too much with this.  We checked out a few books. That's all.  Kind of lame. There was a lot that could have been done, I guess I was too lazy to think of activities.</p>
				<p>Singing Week. We learned songs and sang together. I recorded some Primary songs, and storybooks, put them on an old iPod and speaker dock, which I put in the kids room.  It's so awesome.  Whenever they want a story, I either record it while I read it to them or I just turn on the iPod.  This way, they hear way more stories than usual, but I read about the same amount.  If I go to the library often and get new books, they have books to bring to me that I need to record. </p>  
				<p>Alphabet Week. We played with the kid's alphabet toys, Heidi practiced tracing letters in a notebook, and we watched Sesame Street letter videos.</p>  
				<p>Joke Week.  This one was a lot of fun.  We looked up toddler jokes on my phone and told them to the kids, and explained them, and eventually they came to laugh and retell them. I made Mr. Potato Head-inspired construction paper pieces and we made faces with them on the back of the couch. We also talked about funny jokes and mean jokes.  Putting eyes and a nose on someone's cup is a funny joke, stealing it and watching them cry is a mean joke.</p>
				<p>Sports Week. Round two.  We flipped a coin to let the kids choose the week, and this was Peter's choice.  We brought tennis balls to the basketball court yesterday and to the tennis court today.</p>
