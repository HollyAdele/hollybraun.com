				<h1>Food</h1>
				<p>I love food.  Especially food I did not prepare.  For this reason, I love to go out to eat.  I sit down.  I tell someone what I want.  I can have anything I want.  They bring it to me.  I eat it.  They clean up afterwards. It's amazing.  It's the experience that my children get every day.</p>
				<p>With one difference: many companies and restaurants don't care about me.  They just want me to give them money.  Some sacrifice some profit to serve healthy, sustainable food.  Some sacrifice their customer's health and the environment to serve their own desires for profit. They don't care how much sodium or fat I eat.  They will put as much in as they need to for me to want to eat too much of their food.</p>
				<p>I want my children to enjoy their food, but I also want them to live healthy lives. Eating high-sugar foods for a few seconds is not worth a lifetime of health and behavior problems.</p>
				<h2>Cost</h2>
					<p>The purpose of food is to nourish bodies and relationships. (We get into trouble when we think the sole purpose of food is for pleasure.) Food that nourishes bodies isn't the most expensive food.  Fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, and the proper balance of meat are not the most expensive items on the grocery bill.  If we pay someone at the factory or at the restaurant to prepare food for us, that food is more expensive.  If I had a job, it might make more sense for me to pay someone else to prepare my food.  At the moment, I prefer to prepare it myself.</p>  
					<p>Food that nourishes relationships isn't the most expensive, either. You just need something on the table people want to eat.  If the family is accustomed to eating simple, whole food, then simple, whole food will be all it takes to gather the family.  If the family is used to restaurant amounts of sugar, fat, and sodium, they will complain about simple, whole food.</p>
					<p>This is not to say that we cannot have delicious food.  In restaurants, chefs prepare food with certain equipment with certain techniques.  If you get the equipment, and if you learn the techniques, you can prepare the very same food.  It will take time to learn, but it is not impossible.  You can have delicious, well-prepared food at home.</p>
				<h2>Sugar</h2>
					<p>I have a paralyzing fear of vomit.  One time at a wedding, we gave my 18 month old daughter to a family member, who gave her to another family member, who gave her to another family member... all night. She apparently asked for a cookie from each, and each gave her one. (Just one, though! Each.) I cleaned up those cookies that night.</p>
					<p>It's not satisfying, anyway.  You just want more and more until you feel sick.</p>
