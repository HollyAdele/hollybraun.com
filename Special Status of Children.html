		<h2>Children cannot sin.</h2> <!--Should this be a different color? Should it be centered?-->
			<h3>Knowledge of Law</h3>
				<p> When I was in fifth grade, my friend loaned another girl a dollar.  After a few days, my friend asked me to come with her to ask for one back.  I started to daydream about making her pay interest.  I determined that the interest rate was 100% per day.  I began to calculate how much money that was... and became excited about helping my friend with her debt repayment scheme. </p>
				<p> How much did that girl owe my friend after five days?  <em>One dollar</em>.  If she had known the interest rate when she took the "loan," she would have been morally bound by it.  But because it was just something I made up after the deal was done, she did not owe 500% of the original amount.</p>
				<p> In this way, children are not responsible when they do wrong.  They do wrong so, so often.  They hit. They lie. They covet. They steal. They cheat. They vandalize. They are ungrateful. They do not honor their father and mother. But they don't understand social and moral rules, and they don't understand the consequences.  Therefore, they are not bound by the rules before God and will not suffer the full consequences under his hand. In other words, they are not accountable before God.  They are accountable before me, their mother, though. At home, hitting has a consequence, stealing has a consequence, lying will have a consequence.  I teach them what is wrong by letting them experience the consequences.  But what effect will that sort of discipline have on a child who has not grasped cause and effect? </p>

			<h3>Definition of Sin and Temptation</h3>
				<h4>We sin when we choose to follow Satan instead of God.</h4> 
					<p>Any action is good if God commands it, and any action is bad if Satan commands it. Picking up an object is not inherently evil.  If it is yours and you have intentions to help others, it is good.  If it is not yours, or if you have intentions to hurt others, it is bad.  Physical intimacy is not righteousness or sin by itself.  The context determines everything.  In the context of marriage, it is righteousness.  In the context out of marriage, it is sin.</p>
					<p>If we know we will be following God when we do something, it is righteousness. If we know we will be following Satan when we do something, it is sin.</p>
				<h4>Temptation is a test of a person's ability to choose to follow God instead of Satan.</h4>
					<p>We cannot see God or Satan, it takes considerable time to learn what each of them wants us to do, and it also takes time to learn to pros and cons of following each. You cannot say a child has chosen to follow the devil when he does not truly grasp who Satan is and why he wants him to do what he did.<p/>
		<h2>Requirements of Repentance</h2>
			<p>A repentant soul is one who feels Godly sorrow for their sin. Can someone feel Godly sorrow who doesn't know it was wrong? Who can't yet know it was wrong?</p>
			<p>Part of repenting is not doing the sin again. Self-discipline is cultivated, exercised. It grows stronger with use. Therefore, it is weak without use. Two or three or four (or seven and three quarters) years is not enough time to cultivate self-discipline.</p>
		<h2>Implications for Parents</h2>
			<p>I do not need to be offended when my children do wrong.  I should not be shocked. I really should not be angry.  I should administer the proper consequence and accompanying teaching words, in the most effective manner. Angry words is not the most effective manner.</p>
			<p>At the end of the day, the child who has hit her brother after he took back the toys that she stole from him in the first place--has not sinned.  The mother who criticized and belittled them--has sinned. </p>
			<p>Which is worse: letting the children get away with hitting (and not yelling or hitting) or yelling and hitting to teach them not to hit? <strong>Which one has taught them to yell or hit?</strong></p>
